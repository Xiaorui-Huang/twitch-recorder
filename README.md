## The Noob Manual

**Windows**

1. Open PowerShell (open the Start menu and search for it. If you can't find this, I literally can't help youü§£).

2. Install the Scoop package manager by copying the following into the command line (same instructions as in [https://scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh)):
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression
    ```

3. Install Python, FFmpeg, and Git:
    ```powershell
    scoop bucket add main
    scoop install python ffmpeg git
    ```

4. Clone the code repository:
    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/Xiaorui-Huang/twitch-recorder.git
    cd twitch-recorder
    ```

5. Record the path to this code's directory:
    ```powershell
    pwd  # then copy the output and save it

    # to get back to it later, use:
    cd <the path you just copied and saved>
    ```

6. Proceed to [Installation](#installation) **AND always execute the commands in the code's directory**.

**Mac**

Not gonna help a Mac userüôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è 

(Fine, just go to [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/) and figure it out yourself. Mac might even have Python pre-installed, idk.)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlink asyncio
    ```
3. Ensure FFmpeg is installed and available in your system PATH.

## Quick Start

1. Run the script with a Twitch username:
    ```bash
    python twitch_recorder.py <username>
    ```
    This will start recording the stream in the best available quality.

2. To list available stream qualities:
    ```bash
    python twitch_recorder.py <username> -l
    ```

3. To record with a specific quality:
    ```bash
    python twitch_recorder.py <username> -q 720p
    ```

4. To customize the retry delay (default is 5 minutes):
    ```bash
    python twitch_recorder.py <username> -r 600  # Retry every 10 minutes
    ```

5. Press Ctrl+C to stop recording. The script will attempt to finalize the recording up to this point and save it.

6. Check your **Downloads** folder and Pog.

## Usage

```bash
python twitch_recorder.py [-h] [-l] [-q QUALITY] [-d DELAY] [-o SAVE_PATH] username
```

### Positional arguments:

- `username`: Twitch username of the streamer

### Optional arguments:

- `-h`, `--help`: Show help message and exit
- `-l`, `--list`: List available stream qualities
- `-q QUALITY`, `--quality QUALITY`: Choose stream quality (default: best)
- `-d DELAY`, `--delay DELAY`: Set retry delay in seconds if stream is not live (default: 300 seconds)
- `-o SAVE_PATH`, `--output SAVE_PATH`: Choose a custom directory to save the recordings (default: ~/Downloads/twitch_recordings)

## Configuration

On the first run, you'll be prompted to choose an output folder. This path will be saved in a `config.ini` file for future runs.
